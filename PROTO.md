# Using webpack to load stories

- Prototype to require config from storybook
  - Figure out framework, for example by `.bin` directory link
    - `require.resolve` by storybook core
    - get node_modules part
    - `path.join` with `.bin/start-storybook`
    - `fs.readlinkSynk`
    - parse framework part
  - require internal webpack config builder function
  - require webpack
  - set target to `nodejs`
- Write webpack plugin to remove unnecessary code
  - (???) Plugin should modify code before any loaders
  - delete stories functions body content
  - delete all unused variables/imports in tests
  - Stories file should contains only stories meta and tests
- (???) Load stories from webpack bundle
- Watch ability
  - Output webpack bundle in nodejs cache
  - Watch original files by chokidar => collect changed files
  - webpack watch => build done => load stories, reset test only for changed files
- Optional
  - split bundle chunk as 1:1 (one source module => 1 bundle chunk module)
  - Watch and build bundle only in master process or separate process
  - Workers should watch bundle directory and load test from where
